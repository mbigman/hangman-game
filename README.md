# Hangman
### Advanced Topics Project #1

## Overview
Your goal for this project is to create a playable version of the game Hangman on the command line. You can work in groups of up to two people. For this project, you will need to use all of the concepts we have learned so far: variables, input, loops, conditional and methods. Additionally, you might fight other concepts that we have not yet covered to be useful. If that is the case, look them up to familiarize yourself and ask Mr. Bigman for a mini lesson. 

## Planning
Before starting the program, you need to submit a plan. Use decomposition and pseudocode to help you. 

## Requirements
Your program should include the following:
* The ability for the user to guess a letter
    * Reject the input if the user enters anything that is not a single letter (i.e. numbers, characters, multiple letters)
        * For this game, the user cannot guess a full word 
    * Reject the input if the user has already guessed that letter 
* A counter for how many guesses remain
    * No need for a visual hangman at this point (add visuals as a challenge)
* A way to reveal the correctly guessed letters in a word 
* A "you win" message + a "game over" message 
* Randomly select a word from a (short) list of words 

## Challenges: 
* Words of different lengths 
* Add visuals
